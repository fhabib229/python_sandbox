# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['John', 'Paul', 'Sarah', 'Susan']

# Simple for loop
#for in like es6
for person in people:
  print(f'Current Person: {person}')

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
